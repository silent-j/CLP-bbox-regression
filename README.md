# CLP-bbox-regression

This repo explores object localization with bounding-box regression. Keras will be used to predict bounding-box coordinates with a pre-trained convolutional neural network, modified for regression. Data can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/car-plate-detection).
